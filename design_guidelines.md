**System-Based Approach**: Utilizing Bootstrap framework with custom educational-focused styling for a clean, accessible learning environment optimized for high school students.

## Core Design Elements

- White background (255 100% 100%) for maximum readability
- Blue accent (210 85% 45%) for primary interactive elements and headings
- Green accent (150 70% 40%) for environmental themes and secondary actions

- Light gray (220 10% 96%) for subtle backgrounds and cards

### B. Typography
**Font System:**

- Headings: 'Montserrat' or similar modern sans-serif for titles
- Sizes: 16px base, 1.2rem scale factor for hierarchical headings
- Weight variations: 400 (regular), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Framework:**
- Primary spacing units: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px (Bootstrap's rem equivalents)
- Container max-width: 1140px with responsive breakpoints

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**

- Clean white background with subtle shadow
- Blue hover states for menu items
- Mobile hamburger menu with slide-down animation

**Content Cards:**
- White background with subtle border (1px solid light gray)
- 16px border-radius for modern appearance
- 8px box-shadow for depth without distraction
- 24px internal padding

**Interactive Elements:**
- Primary buttons: Blue background, white text, 8px border-radius
- Secondary buttons: Green background for environmental actions
- Quiz elements: Card-based with immediate color feedback (green/red)
- Modal overlays: Semi-transparent backdrop with centered content

**Educational Components:**

- Interactive panels: Expandable sections with smooth transitions

### E. Animations
**Minimal Motion Design:**

- Smooth page transitions between sections
- Quiz feedback animations (color changes, checkmarks)
- Modal fade-in/fade-out transitions
- No distracting or excessive animations

## Images
**Image Strategy:**
- **No large hero image**: Clean, text-focused homepage with project introduction
- **Educational diagrams**: Carbon cycle process illustrations on dedicated pages
- **Infographic displays**: High-quality scientific diagrams in gallery format
- **Portrait image**: Small Primo Levi photograph for literature section
- **Environmental imagery**: Subtle background images for context (forests, atmosphere)
- **Icon usage**: Simple line icons from Heroicons for navigation and features

## Page-Specific Considerations

**Homepage**: Clean layout with project title, brief introduction, and clear navigation cards to all sections

**Quiz Section**: Card-based question layout with immediate visual feedback using color coding

**Infographics**: Masonry or grid layout with modal popup functionality for detailed viewing

**Literature Page**: Elegant typography-focused design with prominent quote sections and reflective elements

**Footer**: Consistent across all pages with project attribution, bibliography link, and educational disclaimer

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- High contrast ratios for all text combinations
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints
- Semantic HTML structure throughout
- Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Italian language optimization with proper typography

This design creates a professional, educational environment that balances visual appeal with learning effectiveness, perfectly suited for high school chemistry and environmental education resources.
